Please download the linear_svmpredictor.pkl, linearsvmpredictor.py and runthis.sh for predicting one transmembrane B-barrel's topology

You only need to run the bash script (runthis.sh) and the prediction will be printed on the terminal, and output to a file localed at the same location as the fasta file of the to-be-predicted transmembrane B-barrel.
